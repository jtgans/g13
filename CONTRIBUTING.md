## Contributing Code

You are welcome to contribute code to G13GUI in order to fix bugs or
implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

  1. You must be aware of the [license](LICENSE) this project is licensed
     under, and *agree to the Contributors License Agreement* below. This
     is common practice in all major Open Source projects.

  2. *Not all proposed contributions will be accepted*.

## Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else) you have to be
aware that your contribution will be licensed by the same license that is
applied to the project itself.

This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of
a company. If you agree to its content, you simply have to write "I agree
to the Contributor License Agreement" in a comment on your pull request.

An explicit carveout is provided for trivial fixes, such as typos, or any
other contribution of less than three lines of code changed or added, which
does not require agreement to the CLA.
